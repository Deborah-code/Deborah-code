### I'm a London-based Software Engineer with a passion for engineering and making a difference through technology. With experience working with cross-functional product teams and a background in non-coding STEM, I'm always looking for ways to leverage software engineering to solve complex problems and support vibrant tech communities.

#### About Me


- ðŸ”­ I'm currently leading the tech team at Young People in Tech (YPIT), where we're building the website with modern web technologies like Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS.
- ðŸŒ± I'm passionate about open source and have spearheaded the creation of an open-source React/Next.js project library, aiming to foster an active community through meetups, documentation, and support.
- ðŸ‘¯ I've volunteered my tech skills at Code Your Future, AnitaBorg and Women Who Code London, focusing on teaching best practices and reviewing talk proposals to ensure high-quality, engaging technical content.
-  ðŸ“š When I'm not coding, you can find me lost in the world of John Grisham's legal thrillers or exploring historical fiction.
